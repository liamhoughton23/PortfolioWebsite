 <p>Some might argue that the iPad mini is Apple’s first truly post-Steve product. After all, Steve Jobs famously railed against 7-inch Android tablets, calling them “tweeners” that “sucked to use” without having sandpaper to file your digits down to points.

But then again, Steve Jobs was a blustery man, and said many things he didn’t really believe. For example, he once said that the iPod would never get video support, because no one wanted to watch video on a tiny display. He often said things he didn’t mean to throw off the competition.

It turns out that secretly, Steve Jobs was very interested in a smaller iPad. In recent testimony in the Samsung trial, Apple senior VP of iOS software Scott Forstall said he’d turned Steve Jobs around on the idea of 7-inch tablets.

“Having used a Samsung Galaxy [Tab],” Cue wrote, “I tend to agree with many of the comments [in the editorial] (except actually moving off the iPad). I believe there will be a 7″ market and we should do one.”

Cue says he “expressed this to Steve several times since Thanksgiving and he seemed very receptive.” When the iPad mini is announced later this month, it’ll be yet another product that Steve Jobs directly had his hand in.

For everything we think we know about what the iPad mini will be and when it’s coming out, read our feature here.</p>

   <p> Steve Jobs had a strange relationship with automobiles. He famously capitalized upon an obscure Californian law so that he never had to have license plates on his car and could exchange it every six months for an identical model of his favorite auto, a Mercedes SL55 AMG.

But Steve eventually wanted to get into the car business. According to J. Crew CEO and Apple board member Mickey Drexler, in fact, Jobs’s eventual dream was to create an Apple-branded iCar.</p>
